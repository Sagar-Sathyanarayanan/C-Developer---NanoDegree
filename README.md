## First Code is C++ 

```
# include <iostream>
using std::cout; 

int main() {
    cout << "Hello World"<<"\n";

```

1. The **# include** is a preprocessed command which is executed before the code is complied. 
2. The **<iostream>.** containts declerations of input/output objects.
3. The **using std::** containts all the standard librabries used in  C++
